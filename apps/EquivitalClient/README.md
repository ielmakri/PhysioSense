## Description
Reads stream from Equivital software and creates an LSL outlet with the data.

---
## Issues & Todos: 
> **TODO**: SDK has been purchased and not implemented. With the SDK, there is no need to run eqView Professional to access the sensor data.

> **TODO**: Equivital streams alarm codes. If needed, those can be displayed in client application interface.
